# Formatting-Date

We all know that the value created form a Date input is always in a different order.

For Example:
```
const Date = document.getElementById("Example-id").value 
```
this date would be shown as ```2019-02-01```


<p>This simple code make your Date in <strong>DD.MM.YYYY</storng> order.</p>
